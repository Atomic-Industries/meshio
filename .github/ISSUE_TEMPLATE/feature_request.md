Would you like support for a new mesh format in meshio? First check the existing issues,
there are a number of format requests already. It's often easy to get rudimentary
support for a format, so don't be afraid to start a PR!

Consider posting in https://github.com/nschloe/meshio/discussions for feedback before raising a feature request.

**How would you improve meshio?**

Give as much detail as you can. Example code of how you would like it to work would help.

**What problem does it solved for you?**

What problem do you have that this feature would solve? I may be able to suggest an existing way of solving it.

**Did I help**

If I was able to resolve your problem, consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/nschloe) my work on meshio, or [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/nschloe) to say thanks.
